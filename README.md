The World of Warcraft character generator is meant to generate a random character for the user to play on World of Warcraft.
I have included randomized name, race, class, and specialization.
The program first picks a race. The race determines what classes are available, so it then picks a class. Once it picks the class, it picks one of the available specializations for that class.
The randomized name is generated as a 6 letter name with the second and fifth letters being vowels, following the same rules that World of Warcraft uses for their randomized pet names.
